2. **Metadata Extraction**: The assistant could extract metadata from the PDFs such as the title, authors, abstract, and keywords. This metadata could be used to create a searchable database of your PDFs.

3. **Reading List**: The assistant could maintain a reading list for you. You could add PDFs to the list and mark them as read or unread. The assistant could also suggest PDFs from your collection based on your reading habits.

4. **Summary Generation**: The assistant could generate a summary of each PDF for quick reference. This could involve using natural language processing techniques to extract the main points from the document.

5. **Citation Management**: The assistant could help manage citations for your research. It could format citations in various styles and create a bibliography for your papers.

6. **Note-Taking**: The assistant could provide a feature for taking notes on each PDF. These notes could be stored alongside the PDF for easy reference.

7. **Reminder System**: The assistant could remind you to read PDFs that have been on your reading list for a while. It could also remind you of deadlines for your research papers.

8. **Integration with Other Tools**: The assistant could be integrated with other tools that you use for your research, such as reference management software, word processors, and project management tools.
